#In this component, we use the useState hook to keep track of the list of Pokemon, the URL for the next page of results, whether there are more pages to fetch, and whether the component is currently loading more data. I use the useEffect hook to fetch the initial page of Pokemon data when the component mounts.

#I also define a loadMore function that fetches the next page of results and adds them to the existing list of Pokemon using the spread operator. I use this function as the next prop of the InfiniteScroll component provided by the react-infinite-scroll-component library.

#The hasMore prop is used to indicate whether there are more pages to fetch. I set it to true by default, and it will be set to false once we have fetched all the pages.

#Finally, we render the list of Pokemon using the map function, and wrap it inside the InfiniteScroll component. I also show a loading indicator while we're fetching more data, and a message when we have reached the end of the list.
